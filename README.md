# Credit Card Approval Prediction


## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a credit card application will be approved or not. The model utilizes a dataset containing various attributes of credit card applications, including income levels, loan balances, and credit report inquiries.
The dataset used in this project is the [ Credit Card Approval dataset ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/27/credit+approval)
 from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Background
Commercial banks handle a large volume of credit card applications daily, which can be a time-consuming and error-prone process when done manually. Automating the approval process using machine learning algorithms enables banks to streamline operations, reduce processing time, and enhance decision-making accuracy.
